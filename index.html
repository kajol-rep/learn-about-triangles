            What is a Triangle?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Triangle is a closed, two dimensional shape. Triangle is also a polygon.

        </p>
        <h2>
            Properties of a Triangle
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                It has three vertices, three edges and three angles.
            </li>
            <li>
                A triangle that has three vertices A, B and C then the triangle is denoted
                as ∆ABC.
            </li>
            <li>
                The sum of the three interior angles of a triangle is always 180°.
            </li>
            <li>
                The area of a triangle is equal to half of the product of its base and height.
            </li>
            <li>
                The sum of the length of two sides of a triangle is always greater than the length of the third side.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Types of Triangles
        </h2>
        <p>
            Triangles can be classified based on two properties i.e, <span>sides</span> and <span>angles</span>.

            <strong>
                Equilateral triangle:
            </strong>
            A triangle having all the three sides of equal length is an equilateral triangle.
            Since all sides are equal, all angles are equal too.

                Isosceles triangle:
            </strong>
            A triangle having two sides of equal length is an Isosceles triangle. 
            The two angles opposite to the equal sides are equal.

                Acute triangle:
            </strong>
            An acute angle triangle is a triangle in which all the three interior angles are less than 90 degrees.

                Right triangle:
            </strong>
            A right triangle is a triangle in which one of the angles is exactly 90 degrees.  
            The hypotenuse is side of a right triangle with the longest length.
